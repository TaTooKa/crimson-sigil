# HOW TO PLAY

## WHAT'S THIS ABOUT? 

<span class="fuchsia bold">cy.br</span>/<span class="turquoise bold">dys.top.ia</span> is a roleplaying game set in a dystopic cyberpunk setting. 

You take the role of a *runner*: a mercenary, vigilante, hacker, anti-hero, or a combination of those. *Runners* usually fight against the oppression of the **MEGACORPS** that rule the world (although sometimes, they find themselves in need of working FOR the corps, albeit temporarily).

The setting of <span class="fuchsia bold">cy.br</span>/<span class="turquoise bold">dys.top.ia</span> is what is known as *"anti-cannon"* : It could have all the tropes of the cyberpunk genre, but nothing is written in stone. It is yours to shape however you like. Maybe your city is reminiscent of *The Sprawl*, or perhaps your game takes place in an orbital metropolis inside a *Stanford Torus*. Perhaps there's *replicants* roaming about, trying to free themselves from their corporate slavers, or maybe they are actively hunting or impersonating people and snatching their appeareances. Maybe in this world of yours, society has discovered how to digitally back up minds and humanity has become effectively immortal. Perhaps true AI exists and has its own devises, which brings lots of philosophical questions to civilization. You are free to pick or discard any trope or tenet of the cyberpunk genre to curate your own setting however you like.

## BUT... HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS?

A roleplaying game is a narrative activity, usually structured as a conversation between two or more people (or, if you are playing SOLO, with yourself or a written journal!). All the participants interpret a Character and describe their actions, desires and thoughts. Together they take turns to narrate a collaborative story. But this is not just a *make-believe excercise* or *improv session* : It is also a game, which means there are rules to follow, and sometimes whatever you decided your Character tries might fail. This is when the dice come into play: To adjudicate when something with fictional importance succeeds or fails. There's also a random factor implied with the Oracles, for when you need help to kickstart your creativity or when you don't know how to continue making stuff up. 

### PROMPTS AND TRIGGERS

This game has a list of PROMPTS, which are the main mechanical parts of the system. Prompts are comprised of a TRIGGER and some RESULTS, and some have options for you to make a choice.

The TRIGGER is something that happens in the fiction as the players narrate the story or their Characters' actions.

The RESULTS usually depend on the outcome of a dice roll, and are divided into SUCCESS and FAILURE (with optional extras for CRITICAL SUCCESS or FAILURE). 

> Later on you will learn how to roll the dice when prompted, and against what value you should compare to find out if you SUCCEED or FAIL at an action or narrative beat.

### LET FATE DECIDE

Since this game is designed for collaborative, improvised storytelling and on-the-spot world-building, you don't have a pre-defined story or sandbox scenario to run. Some people love to ad-lib and come up with every detail on their own, but this is rare and often very hard, unless that's your trade IRL. For the rest of us mortals, ORACLES come to help. 

ORACLES are basically random tables of content related to a topic, useful when you need to come up with details for something and you don't want to make it up yourself. In these situations, you just QUERY THE FATES and Spark an Idea by using one of the many Oracles at hand in this web app. This helps move the story along without much delay, and sometimes surprises you with things or ideas that you might've not thought about. 

## WHERE DO YOU PLAY THIS?

Traditional RPGs evolved from tabletop wargames in the 1970's, which meant that players needed to gather around a table and talk to each other in person. Fortunately, advances in technology now make it possible to play remotely through any videoconference app and a web-browser. Many RPers love the classic way of playing together at the same place in a social gathering, and <span class="fuchsia bold">cy.br</span>/<span class="turquoise bold">dys.top.ia</span> obviously supports that mode, but it is also designed to be played online without much hassle.

In any case, each player will need some way to use this app on their own, be it with a mobile device capable of browsing the web, or with a hardwired computer. 

> For random rolling, it is recommended to use real dice (this game uses percentile dice, found in most hobby stores). But if you want to follow the trend established by this digital app, it is perfectly fine to use random generators (or virtual dice rollers) on your electronic device.

## HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?

A session of <span class="fuchsia bold">cy.br</span>/<span class="turquoise bold">dys.top.ia</span> can take however you want, but the usual is 1 to 4 hours, depending on each participant desires, taste or schedule. It is also a game that can be played once, or many times. The same story (with the same characters and plot) can be continued over the course of many sessions, or you can do different stories each time you sit to play.

More on that later, on the WHEN DOES THE GAME END? section.

## THE THREE GAME MODES

This game supports three different game modes: <b>SOLO</b>, <b>COOP</b> or <b>GUIDED</b>.

> **SOLO** means it's just you, playing the game with a single Character, all by yourself. You also need to envision what happens with the environment and other characters around your protagonist. You will make the decisions for all of them, or use ORACLES to delegate those choices to fate. <br/>Some people like to talk out loud or record (or even stream!) themselves while playing. Others like to remain silent and envision every narrative beat to themselves, or write it down in a journal. Some even use this to write fiction. <br/>Experiment and use whatever method you like best. 

> **COOP** means there's 2 or more players each roleplaying a Character of their own. They make decisions for their own characters and also brainstorm and envision what happens with the environment and the Non-Player Characters (NPCs). There's noone in charge; everyone has the same duties and authority. <br/>Some groups like to let a single player take the reins for each scene and rotate the responsibility. Others like to discuss each decision and throw ideas or narrate as they come up with new details. <br/>There's no right or wrong here; Use whatever works best for your group.

> **GUIDED** means there's someone playing as **THE GUIDE**, while the rest of the participants play as single Characters. In other Role-playing games this role is known as the <i>Game-Master</i>, or the <i>Referee</i>. <br/>Usually, the GUIDE doesn't play as a Character, but instead describes (and has authoritative control over) the environment and all NPCs that are not the player Characters. This way, the rest of the players can lay back and leave the burden of improvising every story beat or twist to the more experienced GUIDE (while they focus solely on their own Characters). <br/>Other groups prefer to have each Character be proactive, carrying the story by themselves and pursuing their own goals in an active manner, while the GUIDE reacts to those decisions and surprises them with unexpected situations.
