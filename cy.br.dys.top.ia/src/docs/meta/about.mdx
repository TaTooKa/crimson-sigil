# ABOUT THIS GAME

cy.br/dys.top.ia is a tabletop RPG reference document, interactive character sheet and rules' manual all in one, in website format.
It is designed specifically to be played around a table with friends, each using a device (smartphone, tablet, notebook) to record their character, and using real dice (you will need d100s, or d%s).

But it can also be played remotely through the internet, using a videoconference app and a web-browser.
